Health Finder (WIP NAME)

Uses a form filled by the patient to suggest/ match them with a healthcare provider that fits their needs. AFter that it may start a conversation with them or even serve as a payment kiosk.

It will display

Doctor Name | Specialty | Rating(5 Stars) | Location | Languages | Insurance | Cost

As well as some relevant links to the patient, such as mental wellbeing for someone searching for a psychiatrist. Links to nearby hospital's websites & more as it comes up.

The way those links would be triggered is if a certain keyword is found in the entire form. Searching for a psychiatrist would make the results page give the mental health links. Locations will give links to the local hospitals.

Technology used: C#, MVC ASP.NET, SQL, Web API, Angular, CSS and HTML.
